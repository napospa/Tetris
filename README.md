# Tetris

My first ever game developed in Unity, looks simple but it gave me couple of tough sleepless nights. Also if you think code is messy, you should see first version :]

In fact it's really dummy, but keep in mind it is just learning project which I made outside any tutorial. I tried couple of tutorials on YT or Udemy, but alway ended up feeling completely lost right after creating blank project in Unity ([thank you Mark for helping me out here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo) 

And even if it is so simple, I've learned couple of nice things with Unity and C#:
- how to move objects without physics
- how time works in Unity
- finding elements on screen based on different criteria (name, tag)
- accessing variables from another class
- 2d arrays, Mathf, instantiate, ...


Known bugs:
- full scrren is breaking up layout
- when "I" tetronimo is last one, game over not working properly
