# Tetris

My first ever game developed in Unity, looks simple but it gave me couple of tough sleepless nights. Also if you think code is messy, you should see first version :]

In fact it's really dummy, but keep in mind it is just learning project which I made outside any tutorial. I tried couple of tutorials on YT or Udemy, but alway ended up feeling completely lost right after creating blank project in Unity ([thank you Mark for helping me out here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo)
